# Artificial Intelligence:
## automate intellectual tasks that are usually performed by humans

## Hierarchy: General to Specific
### -> Artificial Intelligence
### -> Machine Learning
### -> Neural Networks
####    - form of machine learning that uses a layered representation of data.
####    - Input layer, Middle layers, Output layers
####    - Not modeled after the brain

## Label Vs. Features
### Label => Output
### Features => Input

# TENSORFLOWW
## Tensor
###     -> A generalization of vectors and matricesm to potentially higher dimension.
## Rank / Degree of Tensor
###     -> Dimension of the tensor in terms of numpy
## Shape of Tensor
###     -> Literal dimension of the tensor as a matrix

# TensorFlow Core Learning Algo
## Training VS. Test
### Training - Contains a full data set that has complete features
### Test - Contains only a subset of the training data set and has purposedly lacking features that will be used for predictions.

## Linear Regression

## Classification

## Clustering

## Hidden matrix
